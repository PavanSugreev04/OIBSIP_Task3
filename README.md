- Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw funds from their account.
- Transfer Funds: Users can transfer funds to another account.
- View Transaction History: Users can view their transaction history.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The core programming language used for implementing the ATM logic.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project follows OOP principles for modularity and reusability.
- Scanner Class: Used for taking user input from the console.
- HashMap: Used for storing user account details in memory.
- GitHub: Used for version control and project management.
